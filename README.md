# Pset1-CS50x

## Description:

* hello.c : 
    - This is my first task from the course cs'50, my first code in C.
    My task was to modify this program in such a way that it first prompts the user for their name and then prints "hello, their actual name."


* mario.c : 
    - My task was to recreate that pyramid in C, albeit in text, using hashes (#) for bricks, a la the below. Each hash is a bit taller than it is wide, so the pyramid itself will also be taller than it is wide and should be right-aligned and I should allow the user to decide just how tall the pyramid should be by first prompting them for a positive integer between, say, 1 and 8, inclusive.

* cash.c:
    - this file was already implemented most of all and the program should prompts the user for the number of cents that a customer is owed and then prints the smallest number of coins with which that change can be made and my task was to implement: get_cents calculate_quarters, calculate_dimes, calculate_nickels, calculate_pennies.
